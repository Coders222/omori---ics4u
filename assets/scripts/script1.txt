Life can be a never-ending labyrinth, twisting and turning, trapping us within its complex corridors. Every step I take, it feels like I'm sinking deeper into this abyss of whitespace, where hope becomes a distant memory. I wake up each day to see the same colors and objects. There is nothing for me. I wonder when and how I can leave this miserable state.
