gameplay
- okay so you are in WHITESPACE and you may be wandering aimlessly
- even though the pills are highly dangerous, you must take them to start

- you will be brought to JUNKYARD. Listen to KEL and read the scripts.
- melons and other interactables can be grabbed by pressing 'z'
- there is a secret door that allows you to get on the roof of the buildings
- well its not really a secret, but if you explore enough you'll find an opening

- during battle, you need to use your arrow keys to choose an option
- use X to select whatever button you want.
- also, you cannot beat the boss without any heals

- after you beat the boss, you will be taken to BLACKSPACE
- read the book, find the correct door to exit the game or you will be punished

FUNCTIONALITIES
- I think we were planning to allow the user to customize the controls but dropped it
- we also did not add obstacles or the ability to remove obstacles in the map. 
- no skins for the character

BUGS 
- when you interact with an object while moving, you will be stuck in that animation
  frame until you start moving again.
- after you beat the boss, his ending dialogue is cut short
- if u lose to the boss, a small frame of no dialogue is shown
